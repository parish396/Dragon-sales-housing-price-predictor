House Price Prediction Machine Learning ProjectThis project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a given dataset. It uses Python with popular libraries like pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning, and numpy for numerical operations.Table of ContentsAbout the ProjectDatasetFeatures and TargetSetup InstructionsHow to RunModel Evaluation MetricsFuture EnhancementsAbout the ProjectThe goal of this project is to build a robust regression model capable of predicting house prices. The model is trained on a provided dataset, which is assumed to be a CSV file without a header, where the last column represents the house price. The RandomForestRegressor algorithm is used for its effectiveness in handling various data types and its ability to capture complex relationships.DatasetThe project uses a CSV file named data.csv. This file is expected to contain numerical features and the target variable (house price) as the last column, without a header row.Example data format (first few lines of data.csv):0.00632,18,2.31,0,0.538,6.575,65.2,4.09,1,296,15.3,396.9,4.98,24
0.02731,0,7.07,0,0.469,6.421,78.9,4.9671,2,242,17.8,396.9,9.14,21.6

Features and TargetThe script automatically assigns generic column names (feature_0, feature_1, ...) to the input features and names the last column price, which is treated as the target variable for prediction.Setup InstructionsTo set up and run this project, you need Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries.Install Python:If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org.Clone the repository (if applicable) or save the files:If this project is part of a GitHub repository, clone it:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Otherwise, simply save the provided Python script (e.g., house_price_prediction.py) and your data.csv file in the same directory.Install required Python libraries:Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
How to RunEnsure data.csv is in the correct location:Local Machine: Place data.csv in the same directory as your Python script (e.g., house_price_prediction.py).Google Colab: Upload data.csv to your Colab session's file system. In the left sidebar, click the folder icon, then the "Upload to session storage" icon, and select data.csv.Execute the Python script:Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your files are saved, and run:python house_price_prediction.py
If you are using Google Colab, simply run the code cell containing the script.The script will print the data loading status, data information, missing value handling details, and finally, the model's evaluation metrics.Model Evaluation MetricsThe script outputs the following metrics to assess the model's performance:Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Lower is better.Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences. Penalizes larger errors more. Lower is better.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, bringing the error back to the original units of the target variable. Lower is better.R-squared (R2) Score: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features. Closer to 1 is better.Feature Importances: Shows which features contributed most significantly to the predictions.Future EnhancementsHyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the RandomForestRegressor (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms) to potentially improve model accuracy.Alternative Models: Try other regression algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, or even neural networks for comparison.Data Visualization: Add plots to visualize data distributions, correlations, and model predictions vs. actual values.Deployment: Explore deploying the trained model as a web service using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
